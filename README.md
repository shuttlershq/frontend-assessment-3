# frontend-assessment
As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a take home assessment.


# Expectations

Given the travel history of a vehicle - as a collection of geolocation points and time stamp, design a frontend application that provides a way to replay the travel history such that the user of the application can choose from a list of available vehicles,

provide a time period and loads the trip history into the "Trip Playback screen"

The trip playback screen should allow the user of the app

- Provide this playback on a map
- Jump to a specific point using a range control
- Provide option to change the playback speed up to 10X faster than how events happened
- Draw the trail of the trip on the map as the trip progresses from the first point to the last point


Please take note of the following points:

- Only use Vue or React to get it done
- Any Css framework is fine. Tailwindcss will be an added advantage
- A Mobile Responsive design will be an added advantage
- Also make sure that your project is on github and accessible to us

You'll be assessed based on but not limited to the following:

- Design implementation
- Coding pattern
- Proper Component decomposition and reuse
- Correctness of javascript syntax
- Demonstration of knowledge of the chosen framework between Vue or React

### How do I submit? ###
* Create a github repository, implement your solution and send us the link.
* Create a ReadMe file with `firstname-lastname.md` (where firstname and lastname are your 
  first and last name respectively) where you add relevant information on how to setup/run/test your submission
